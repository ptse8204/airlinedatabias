# Welcome to the Airline Pricing Model Bias Repositary

## Introduction
This repositary showcase how we investigate on how airline price discriminate on certain protected groups, including but not limit to:
* Race
* Income
* Geo areas

We understand that airfare pricing is a business decision that was driven by revenues. However, by investigating such factors, it may also drives airline's bottom line as the result could be useful for more attractive pricing for passengers.

## Methodology
### Dataset
We uses the Airline Origin and Destination Survey from the USDOT. The main reason why we chose to use such a dataset, instead of the advertising fare of the flight is because the data point represent a fare that is actually purchase by a customers. 
### How does finding bias work?
We aim our investigation (mainly) in 2 directions:
* Investigate whether there is price discrepency in protected groups on existing dataset
* Feed the data on to our custom build models, and see whether the model would generate results that showcase strong bias. In especially models that are extremely accuracte, and has a hard time to correctly identity areas that has a strong influence with protected groups.
